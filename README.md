## 🧠 Key Learnings

Building this project helped me master the following concepts:
1.  **React Hooks:** Managing complex state for the Cart and Search filters using `useState`.
2.  **Asynchronous JS:** Fetching data from an external API using `async/await`.
3.  **Component Architecture:** Breaking down the UI into reusable parts (`Header`, `Card`, `Cart`).
4.  **Array Manipulation:** Using `.map()`, `.filter()`, and `.reduce()` to handle data and calculate totals.
5.  **Conditional Rendering:** Switching between the Home, Cart, and Seller views without routing.
